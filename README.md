## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  I'm Johnson Su :)

I'm a Computer Science student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/home/)!</br>
Currently I'm interested in machine learning and product design </br>

### What am I currently doing?
 -   Object recognition for [Farmbot](https://farm.bot/) with the NVIDIA Jetson Nano.</br>
 -   Working on my own app for tracking/managing meds for the elderly</br>
 -   Hiding text (mainly the Bee Movie script) into images with [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography)</br>
